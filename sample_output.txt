THOUGHT: The error message indicates that the Playwright test timed out while waiting for the element with the data-testid 'money-display' to contain the text "$0.25", but instead it contained "$-0.25". This suggests that the issue might be related to the way the value is being updated or calculated in the React app. To fix this failure, I need to understand how the value is being updated in the React app.

// Export the component for use in other parts of the application.
export default MoneySlot;

THOUGHT: The observation shows the code for the MoneySlot component, which displays the current balance and handles coin insertion. The amountInserted prop is used to display the current balance, and the onInsertQuarter callback is triggered when a quarter is inserted. The issue might be related to how the amountInserted prop is being updated or calculated. Since the error message shows a negative value ($-0.25), it's possible that the amountInserted value is being subtracted instead of added when a quarter is inserted.

THOUGHT: The observation shows the code for the App component, which includes the handleInsertQuarter function. This function is supposed to increment the amountInserted state by $0.25 when a quarter is inserted. However, the code currently decrements the amountInserted state by $0.25 (setAmountInserted(prev => prev - 0.25)). This is likely the cause of the issue, as it would result in a negative value being displayed in the MoneySlot component.

ANSWER: The fix for this failure is to change the line `setAmountInserted(prev => prev - 0.25)` to `setAmountInserted(prev => prev + 0.25)` in the handleInsertQuarter function. This will correctly increment the amountInserted state by $0.25 when a quarter is inserted.
